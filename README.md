# covid19-mexico

This repository was made for analyzing covid19 data from Mexico patients, in particular the main objective 
is to find the top factors asociated with Intensive Care Unit usage by each State of Mexico. 

The data is analized in the jupyter notebook file using python 3.7. The data used is uploaded and was taken
from https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/datos-abiertos-152127

Most of the variables of the data correspond to binary values so we can't use Pearson's correlation to 
analyze the correlation between the different variables, that's the reason we try another approach. 
We add some useful references related to this issue.
